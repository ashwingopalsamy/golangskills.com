# Go performance and diagnostics

Optimize a measured constraint, not a code pattern.

## Establish the workload

Record input distribution, concurrency, duration, warmup, dependencies, hardware, Go version, `GOMAXPROCS`, latency percentiles, throughput, allocations, and error rate. Reproduce the symptom before changing code.

## Follow the dominant resource

- CPU profile: inspect cumulative and flat cost, then verify inlining and call context.
- Heap/allocation profile: distinguish live memory from allocation churn and retained ownership.
- Mutex/block profiles: find contention and waiting, not merely hot functions.
- Goroutine profile: inspect leaks, fan-out, and blocked resource owners.
- Trace: diagnose scheduler latency, GC interaction, network blocking, and critical paths.
- Database/network evidence: local CPU profiles cannot explain remote queueing alone.

## Change one causal mechanism

Common valid moves include capacity hints for known sizes, avoiding repeated conversions, batching within latency bounds, reducing contention scope, changing algorithms, and removing avoidable reflection or formatting from hot paths. Preserve ownership and correctness; pooling can retain memory or create races.

Compare before and after with repeated benchmarks and confidence-aware tooling. Report effect size, allocations, variance, and costs transferred to memory, tail latency, complexity, or dependencies.

Read [references/diagnostic-tree.md](references/diagnostic-tree.md) for profile selection and benchmark traps.

## Output contract

Lead with the measured bottleneck and evidence. Do not claim improvement from code appearance or one noisy benchmark run.
